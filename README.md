# discord_ads_web_app
Web app associated with discord ads bot.

This is going to be a web app with flask as the back end, postgres as the database, front end is TBD. To set up:

`git clone <git clone url>`

`cd discord_ads_web_app`

I use pipenv. Run:

`pipenv install`

to install all python packages, and then run 

`pipenv shell`. 

This will create a virtual environment and put you in it (if you don't know what this means, I would recommend 
looking it up.)

Separately, you'll need to install Postgresql. 

Make sure to change the postgres related env variables in .env to match your environment!
