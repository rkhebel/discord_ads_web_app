## Hello and welcome  to my project

This consists of two largely independent pieces, a frontend (made in vue), a backend (api in flask). The front makes requests to the backend which either returns json data or performs logic/interactions with the db (postgres).

##### Startup instructions:

This starts the flask backend

`cd backend`
`pipenv shell`
`flask run`

This starts the vue frontend

`cd frontend`
`yarn serve`
